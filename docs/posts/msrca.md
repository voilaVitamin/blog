# MSRCA


- I make small software programs which can be used to make money. Currently this is all stored in my personal account, similar to a facebook account. I want to transfer this to a legal entity which holds its ownership. 


- My reason for this entity:
    - Create assets in the name of the organization. 
    - Protect this. 
    - Manage expenses - Company expenditure, Company revenue. 
    - Take subscriptions and patent copyrights
    - No employees for now.

## Question for Faruk uncle

- How to make this entity? Legal requirements?

```
MSME 
```

- I am currently in Canada but I am a temporary resident. So it should be in India. Is that a problem?

```

```

- Trademark vs Copyright vs Patent -> Should I do this online myself? Whose help should I take? Class 9 and Class 42

```

```


- What are types of organizations we can create?
